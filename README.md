# Sturdy Infinity Cube
3D printable Infinity Cube designed with openSCAD.

![Our Infinity Cubes](/images/cubes.jpg)

This cube features strong hinges that won't break when first loosening the print.
The model prints in place.  Size is adjustable.

## Print settings
This model is optimized for 0.2 layer height, including the first(!) layer.
I use no brim and no supports, but hairspray to ensure good adhesion.

Slicer Settings:
* Layer height: 0.2
* Make sure the first layer is 0.2 (e.g. First layer height = 100%)
* Infill: 20%
* Supports: None
* Brim: None
